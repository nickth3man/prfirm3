- **Area: Logging & Configuration**

1. **Title**: Add comprehensive error handling and logging across `main.py`

   **Description**: Several TODOs in `main.py` request improved error handling and logging. Example TODOs at the top of the file: "TODO: Add comprehensive error handling and logging throughout the module" (near file header) and multiple `# TODO:` entries throughout `run_demo`, `create_gradio_interface`, and CLI sections. 
   
   Currently, the application lacks structured logging and consistent error handling patterns. When errors occur in the Gradio interface or during flow execution, users receive generic error messages without proper context or debugging information. The logging configuration uses basic `logging.basicConfig()` which is insufficient for production use.
   
   Implement a consistent logging configuration with structured logging (JSON format for production), add exception handling wrappers for major entry points (`run_demo`, `create_gradio_interface`, `run_flow`), and ensure errors are logged with proper context while excluding sensitive data like API keys or user content.

   **Location**: `main.py` (file header and usages in `run_demo`, `create_gradio_interface`, and `if __name__ == '__main__'` section)

   **Acceptance criteria**:
   - Module exposes a `configure_logging()` function that supports JSON/structured logging and is called for both CLI and Gradio execution paths
   - All major functions (`run_demo`, `create_gradio_interface`, `run_flow`) have try-catch blocks with appropriate logging at ERROR level for exceptions
   - Sensitive data (API keys, user content) is filtered from logs using custom formatters or filters
   - Log messages include request IDs, timestamps, and relevant context (platform, topic hash)
   - Exceptions at flow boundaries are caught, logged at appropriate level, and re-raised or returned with user-friendly messages
   - Linter passes and no hardcoded credentials or secrets are logged
   - Log rotation is configured for file-based logging

   **Suggested labels**: `enhancement`, `logging`, `bug`, `security`

   **Suggested assignees**: `@PocketFlow-maintainer` or `@agentic-coding-team`

2. **Title**: Add proper logging configuration with environment-based controls

   **Description**: Replace ad-hoc `logging.basicConfig` usage with a robust configuration system that supports different environments (development, staging, production). TODOs: `# TODO: Add proper logging configuration`.
   
   The current logging setup is hardcoded and doesn't support different verbosity levels or output formats. In development, developers need DEBUG-level logs with readable formatting, while production requires structured JSON logs with appropriate filtering. The application should support standard logging environment variables and configuration files.

   **Location**: `main.py` near module-level logger initialization and throughout the application

   **Acceptance criteria**:
   - Logging configuration supports `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR` levels via `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable or `--log-level` CLI flag
   - Replace `basicConfig` usage with `logging.config.dictConfig` or custom configuration function
   - Support both human-readable (development) and JSON (production) log formats via `LOG_FORMAT` environment variable
   - Add log file output option via `LOG_FILE` environment variable
   - Include correlation IDs in all log messages for request tracing
   - Log configuration is documented in README with examples

   **Suggested labels**: `enhancement`, `logging`, `configuration`

   **Suggested assignees**: `@PocketFlow-maintainer`

- **Area: Configuration Management**

3. **Title**: Implement comprehensive configuration management for default values and settings

   **Description**: `main.py` contains multiple `TODO` comments requesting configuration management (e.g., defaults for demo, Gradio settings, timeouts, LLM parameters). Currently, configuration values are hardcoded throughout the application, making it difficult to customize behavior for different environments or deployments.
   
   Implement a hierarchical configuration system that loads from environment variables, optional config files (YAML/JSON), and provides sensible defaults. This should include settings for Gradio interface (port, sharing, auth), flow execution (timeouts, retries), LLM parameters (temperature, max tokens), and deployment options (debug mode, CORS settings).

   **Location**: `main.py` (module header), `create_gradio_interface` defaults, and flow execution parameters

   **Acceptance criteria**:
   - Create a `config.py` module or `main.configure_app()` function that reads environment variables and optional YAML/JSON config file
   - Support configuration hierarchy: CLI args > environment variables > config file > defaults
   - Provide typed configuration classes using `dataclasses` or `pydantic` for validation
   - Include settings for: Gradio (port, auth, sharing), flow execution (timeouts, max retries), LLM (temperature, max tokens, model names), logging (level, format, file)
   - Configuration validation with clear error messages for invalid values
   - Document all configuration keys in README with examples and default values
   - Add `--config-file` CLI option to specify custom configuration file path

   **Suggested labels**: `enhancement`, `config`, `documentation`

   **Suggested assignees**: `@PocketFlow-maintainer`

- **Area: Validation & Sanitization**

4. **Title**: Implement comprehensive input validation and sanitization for CLI and Gradio inputs

   **Description**: Multiple TODOs reference input validation for `run_demo()` / `create_gradio_interface()` and `run_flow()` callback. Currently, user inputs (topic, platforms, brand bible content) are not properly validated, which can lead to errors during flow execution or potential security issues.
   
   Add robust validation for all user inputs including topic content (length limits, content filtering), platform name normalization and validation against supported platforms, brand bible content validation, and ensure all user input is sanitized before usage in LLM prompts or file operations.

   **Location**: `main.py`, `run_flow`, `validate_shared_store` function, and Gradio input handlers

   **Acceptance criteria**:
   - `validate_shared_store` function validates all required fields with specific error messages for each validation failure
   - Topic validation: non-empty, reasonable length limits (1-500 chars), basic content filtering for obvious spam/abuse
   - Platform validation: normalize platform names, validate against supported platform list, handle case-insensitive input
   - Brand bible validation: check file size limits, validate XML/JSON format, sanitize content
   - `run_flow` returns structured error responses with field-specific validation messages instead of generic crashes
   - Input sanitization prevents injection attacks in LLM prompts (escape special characters, length limits)
   - Add comprehensive unit tests covering all validation edge cases and attack vectors
   - Rate limiting validation to prevent abuse

   **Suggested labels**: `bug`, `security`, `enhancement`, `validation`

   **Suggested assignees**: `@agentic-coding-team`, `@security-team`

5. **Title**: Add comprehensive support for loading and validating brand bible from external sources

   **Description**: `main.py` currently uses `"brand_bible": {"xml_raw": ""}` as placeholder. The application needs full support for brand bible content from multiple sources: file uploads via Gradio, file paths via CLI, and URL downloads.
   
   Implement file upload handling in Gradio with proper validation, reuse existing `utils/brand_bible_parser.py` for parsing, add support for multiple formats (XML, JSON, plain text), and provide clear error handling for invalid or malformed brand bible content.

   **Location**: `create_gradio_interface` (TODO: Support file uploads for brand bible content), `run_demo` (TODO: Add support for loading brand bible from external files)

   **Acceptance criteria**:
   - Gradio UI supports file upload component for brand bible with file type restrictions (.xml, .json, .txt)
   - File size limits enforced (max 10MB) with clear error messages
   - Support multiple brand bible formats: XML, JSON, plain text with automatic format detection
   - Integration with existing `utils/brand_bible_parser.py` for consistent parsing
   - Uploaded/loaded content is validated and normalized before storing in `shared['brand_bible']`
   - CLI option `--brand-bible-file` to pass brand bible file path
   - CLI option `--brand-bible-url` to download brand bible from URL (with security validation)
   - Clear error handling for parsing failures with specific error messages
   - Preview functionality in Gradio to show parsed brand bible summary

- **Area: Streaming & Real-time**

6. **Title**: Implement comprehensive streaming support for real-time content generation with progress tracking

   **Description**: Add full streaming support for long-running content generation so users receive real-time updates and intermediate results. Currently, users must wait for complete flow execution without any progress indication, leading to poor user experience for long-running operations.
   
   Implement streaming using Gradio's streaming capabilities, server-sent events for status updates, and progress callbacks throughout the flow execution. Include support for streaming LLM responses, platform-specific content generation progress, and error reporting during streaming.

   **Location**: `main.py` (create_gradio_interface and `shared['stream']` usage), flow execution callbacks

   **Acceptance criteria**:
   - Add streaming mode toggle in Gradio UI with clear explanation of benefits
   - Implement progress callback system that reports percentage completion and current step
   - Stream intermediate results as they become available (per-platform content, analysis steps)
