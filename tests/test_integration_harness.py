"""Integration test harness and smoke tests for PR Firm flows.

This module provides a comprehensive testing framework for the Virtual PR Firm
content generation pipeline. It includes mock implementations of external utilities
and provides harness functionality to run end-to-end flow tests in memory without
external dependencies.

Key Features:
- Mock implementations for LLM, parser, and other external utilities
- Harness to construct minimal shared states and run flows  
- Smoke tests for core flow execution (Engagement -> BrandBible -> PlatformFormatting -> ContentCraftsman)
- Deterministic testing with predictable mock responses
- Examples and documentation for writing new integration tests

Usage:
    Run with pytest:
        pytest tests/test_integration_harness.py -v
    
    Or run individual functions:
        python -m pytest tests/test_integration_harness.py::test_core_flow_smoke -v

Examples:
    Basic flow test:
        harness = IntegrationTestHarness()
        shared = harness.create_minimal_shared_state(platforms=["twitter"], topic="AI trends")
        result = harness.run_flow(shared)
        assert "content_pieces" in result
        assert len(result["content_pieces"]) > 0
